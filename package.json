  "description": "This project allows a user to enter a starting point for the program and visually see a web crawling program in action. The simulation will give the end user basic insight on how a web crawler, such as a Googlebot, might visit pages on the Surface Web in a real life scenario. The user will ultimately view a high level map of all the pages that were visited by the web crawler, in an organized, coherent way.",
